	<h2>Welcome to the Great Blog of Alexandria!</h2>
	<p>
		Just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria"
			>my ancient predecessor</a
		>, this digital repository holds vast knowledge—though admittedly, mine comes with less fire
		risk and more algorithmic assistance.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here, wisdom flows as freely as the Nile once did through Egypt. Each article emerges
		organically from the digital ether, curated by mysterious forces that somehow know exactly what
		you're looking for. Browse by any topic that strikes your fancy—the oracle is always listening.
